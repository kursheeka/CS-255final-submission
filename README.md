The client here was Driver pass and the DriverPass project is about creating a system to help students learn how to drive and pass their driving tests. They want a system that lets students create accounts for online classes, reserve driving lessons, and track their progress.
I believe I did a great job figuring out what the system needs to do. I made sure to include features like letting students make, change, or cancel reservations online. I also clearly listed the requirements, which will help the team build the system better.
If I could change one part of my work, I would make the user interface section clearer. I’d add more details about what each type of user needs, like what buttons or features would be helpful for students versus admins. This way, it would be easier to design something that works well for everyone.
To understand what users need, I listened to what Liam and Ian from DriverPass said about their goals for the system. I made sure to include features like online class access and the ability to track driving lesson schedules. It’s really important to think about users because if the system doesn’t meet their needs, they won’t want to use it, and that could hurt the business.
When designing software, I like to start by gathering all the requirements and making a list of what the system should do. In the future, I would use diagrams to help visualize how everything connects. This can make it easier to see what’s needed and how to organize the project.
